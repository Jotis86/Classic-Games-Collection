# 🎮 Game Collection by Jotis 🎮

## 🎯 Objectives
The objective of this project is to create a collection of classic games using Python and Pygame. The games included in this collection are:
- 🐍 Snake Game
- 🏓 Pong Game
- 👾 Space Invaders

## 🕹️ Functionality
### 🐍 Snake Game
Control the snake using the arrow keys. Eat the green food to grow the snake and increase your score. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

### 🏓 Pong Game
Play against the computer. Use the up and down arrow keys to control your paddle. The game ends when the ball goes out of bounds.

### 👾 Space Invaders
Control the spaceship using the left and right arrow keys. Shoot the enemies by pressing the space bar. The game ends when the enemies reach the bottom of the screen.
